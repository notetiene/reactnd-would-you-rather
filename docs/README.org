* Would You Rather Project

  Would you rather is a web application that includes simple polls made
  by its users.  The form of the polls are as follow:

#+begin_quote
Would you rather [option A] or [option B]?
#+end_quote


** Overview
*** Goals of this project

 * Better understanding of React and Redux
 * Practice improving predictability of the application’s state
 * Establishing strict rules for interacting with the store
 * Identify which state should live in Redux
 * Identify which state should live in React components

*** Starter code
    The starter code consists of a =_DATA.js= file which contains a
    fake database and functions to interact with it.

** App functionality
*** TODO Impersonating
    There should be a way to impersonate a existing user.
**** TODO Allow log in and log out
**** TODO On log in, show home page
**** TODO Current user should be shown
*** TODO Permissions
**** TODO User must be logged-in to show pages

     If someone tries to navigate anywhere by entering the address in
     the address bar, the user *is asked to sign in* and then the
     requested page is shown.

*** TODO Home page
#+caption: Question page
[[file:images/home_page.png]]
**** TODO Located at the root ~/~
**** TODO Show answered and unanswered questions
     There should two tabs.
***** TODO Unanswered questions shown by default
**** TODO Show in order
     Show most recent (top) to least recent (bottom).
**** TODO A poll can be clicked
     When clicking on the poll, show the poll page.

*** TODO Question page
**** TODO Located at ~/questions/:question_id~
     Where =:question_id= is the id of the poll/question.
**** TODO Show content
***** Unanswered question
#+caption: Question page (unanswered)
[[file:images/question_page_unanswered.png]]

The unanswered question must contain:
 * [ ] The text =Would you rather=
 * [ ] Avatar of the user who posted the question
 * [ ] Two options

****** When voting
 * [ ] The answer must be recorded
 * [ ] All the information about the question should be displayed
   (answered question)
 * [ ] Users can only vote once and cannot change their answer
 * [ ] When the user comes back to the home page, the question should
   be in the answered section

***** Answered question
#+caption: Question page (unanswered)
[[file:images/question_page_answered.png]]

The answered question must contain:
 * [ ] Text of the option
 * [ ] Number of people who voted for that option
 * [ ] Percentage of people who voted for that option
 * [ ] The option the logged-in user choose

**** TODO Show error if poll doesn’t exist
     Show an error page (404) if the poll doesn’t exist.
*** TODO New question page
**** TODO Located at ~/add~
**** TODO Show content
The page must contain:
 * [ ] The text =Would You Rather=
 * [ ] A form of two options

The page should:
 * [ ] Have indication that the input are required
 * [ ] Have a button submit button that is disabled when the two input are
   not correct, but becomes enabled when the form is correct
 * [ ] Submit the answer when pressing enter
 * [ ] Both input should not be empty or with white space only

**** TODO Handle new question
 * [ ] The new question should appear in the correct category on the
   home page
*** TODO Leaderboard
**** TODO Located at ~/leaderboard~
**** TODO Show content
The list of users and the following:
 * [ ] User’s name
 * [ ] User’s avatar
 * [ ] Number of question the user asked
 * [ ] Number of question the user answered
 * [ ] Sorted by their score (questions + answers)

It should contain the following:
 * [ ] Sum of score
 * [ ] Trophies based on score
   * [ ] No trophy if max score is zero

*** TODO Navbar
    Add a navbar to navigate between:

 * [ ] Home page
 * [ ] New question page
 * [ ] Leader board
 * [ ] Log in or Log out
** App architecture
*** Most state should be managed by Redux
Read: [[https://github.com/reactjs/redux/issues/1287][choosing between Redux’s store and React’s state]]

*** The store is the single source of truth
**** Components should reference to Redux
**** No direct API call in component’s lifecycle methods
     Updates should be triggered by dispatching action creators.
*** Application should be structured
*** Components should be modular and resusable
** App components logic
*** Data architecture

**** Behaviour of routed component
The list of routed components is the following:
 - =Home=
   - Login is required to view the page
     - Otherwise redirect to SignIn
 - =Leaderboard=
   - Login is required to view the page
     - Otherwise redirect to =SignIn=
 - =NewQuestion=
   - Login is required to view the page
     - Otherwise redirect to SignIn
 - =Question=
   - Login is required to view the page
     - Otherwise redirect to =SignIn=
   - When the matched URL contains an invalid question, redirect to
     =PageNotFound=
 - =User=
   - Login is required to view the page
     - Otherwise redirect to =SignIn=
   - When the matched URL contains an invalid user, redirect to
     =PageNotFound=
 - =SignIn=
 - =PageNotFound=

Since many pages (or component) require the user to be logged-in, we
must use a compone that will provide that behaviour.

*** =Home= Component
The =Home= component will provide two list of questions:
 - Unanswered questions
 - Answered questions

Two tabs will be used while showing unanswered questions by default.
This behaviour will be included in the =QuestionList= component.

**** Overview
#+caption: Mockup of =Home= component
#+RESULTS:
[[file:images/home_overview.png]]

This is the view of the =home= component.

1. is a =Question= component
2. is a =Tab.Menu= component
3. is the =Tab.Segment= component
4. is a =QuestionExcerpt= component

**** Data of =Home=
This component will be a connected component to the Redux store.  The
following state properties will be used for mapping:
 - =questions=
 - =authedUser=

The properties mapped will be the following:
 - =answeredQuestions=
   - Obtained by filtering =questions= the current =authedUser= has
     answered and returning the question’s ID property.
 - =unansweredQuestions=
   - Obtained by filtering =questions= the current =authedUser= has
     not answered and returning the question’s ID property.

#+begin_src plantuml :file images/home_component_data.png

      titleBorderRoundCorner 15

  }
#+end_src
#+caption: Data of Home component
#+RESULTS:
[[file:images/home_component_data.png]]

***** =Questions= mapping operations
The =answeredQuestions= will be calculated by first transforming the
=questions= object to a list.  The given list will be filtered by the
predicate that the =authedUser= is included in one of the two options
of the question.  The remaining list will only return the question
IDs.

Likewise =unansweredQuestions= will be calculated by first
transforming the =questions= object to a list.  The given list will be
filtered by the predicate that the =authedUser= is *not* included in
one of the two options of the question.  The remaining list will only
return the question IDs

#+caption: Mapped state properties to the =Home= component properties
#+begin_src js
  function mapStateToProps({ questions, authedUser }) {
    const answeredQuestions = Object.values(questions)
          .filter((question) => question.optionOne.votes.includes(authedUser)
                  || question.optionTwo.votes.includes(authedUser))
          .map((question) => question.id);
    const unansweredQuestions = Object.values(questions)
      .filter((question) => !question.optionOne.votes.includes(authedUser)
              && !question.optionTwo.votes.includes(authedUser))
      .map((question) => question.id);
    return {
      answeredQuestions,
      unansweredQuestions,
    };
  }
#+end_src

**** Tree of =Home=
The following components components will be children of =Home=
 - =Body= for layout
   - =QuestionList= to show answered and unanswered questions.  Both
     properties passed to the component will be a list of question IDs
     as string
