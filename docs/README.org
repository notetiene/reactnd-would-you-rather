#+SETUPFILE: https://fniessen.github.io/org-html-themes/setup/theme-readtheorg.setup

* Would You Rather Project

  Would you rather is a web application that includes simple polls made
  by its users.  The form of the polls are as follow:

#+begin_quote
Would you rather [option A] or [option B]?
#+end_quote


** Overview
*** Goals of this project

 * Better understanding of React and Redux
 * Practice improving predictability of the application’s state
 * Establishing strict rules for interacting with the store
 * Identify which state should live in Redux
 * Identify which state should live in React components

*** Starter code
    The starter code consists of a =_DATA.js= file which contains a
    fake database and functions to interact with it.

** App functionality
*** TODO Impersonating
    There should be a way to impersonate a existing user.
**** TODO Allow log in and log out
**** TODO On log in, show home page
**** TODO Current user should be shown
*** TODO Permissions
**** TODO User must be logged-in to show pages

     If someone tries to navigate anywhere by entering the address in
     the address bar, the user *is asked to sign in* and then the
     requested page is shown.

*** TODO Home page
#+caption: Question page
[[file:images/home_page.png]]
**** TODO Located at the root ~/~
**** TODO Show answered and unanswered questions
     There should two tabs.
***** TODO Unanswered questions shown by default
**** TODO Show in order
     Show most recent (top) to least recent (bottom).
**** TODO A poll can be clicked
     When clicking on the poll, show the poll page.

*** TODO Question page
**** TODO Located at ~/questions/:question_id~
     Where =:question_id= is the id of the poll/question.
**** TODO Show content
***** Unanswered question
#+caption: Question page (unanswered)
[[file:images/question_page_unanswered.png]]

The unanswered question must contain:
 * [ ] The text =Would you rather=
 * [ ] Avatar of the user who posted the question
 * [ ] Two options

****** When voting
 * [ ] The answer must be recorded
 * [ ] All the information about the question should be displayed
   (answered question)
 * [ ] Users can only vote once and cannot change their answer
 * [ ] When the user comes back to the home page, the question should
   be in the answered section

***** Answered question
#+caption: Question page (unanswered)
[[file:images/question_page_answered.png]]

The answered question must contain:
 * [ ] Text of the option
 * [ ] Number of people who voted for that option
 * [ ] Percentage of people who voted for that option
 * [ ] The option the logged-in user choose

**** TODO Show error if poll doesn’t exist
     Show an error page (404) if the poll doesn’t exist.
*** TODO New question page
**** TODO Located at ~/add~
**** TODO Show content
The page must contain:
 * [ ] The text =Would You Rather=
 * [ ] A form of two options

The page should:
 * [ ] Have indication that the input are required
 * [ ] Have a button submit button that is disabled when the two input are
   not correct, but becomes enabled when the form is correct
 * [ ] Submit the answer when pressing enter
 * [ ] Both input should not be empty or with white space only

**** TODO Handle new question
 * [ ] The new question should appear in the correct category on the
   home page
*** TODO Leaderboard
**** TODO Located at ~/leaderboard~
**** TODO Show content
The list of users and the following:
 * [ ] User’s name
 * [ ] User’s avatar
 * [ ] Number of question the user asked
 * [ ] Number of question the user answered
 * [ ] Sorted by their score (questions + answers)

It should contain the following:
 * [ ] Sum of score
 * [ ] Trophies based on score
   * [ ] No trophy if max score is zero

*** TODO Navbar
    Add a navbar to navigate between:

 * [ ] Home page
 * [ ] New question page
 * [ ] Leader board
 * [ ] Log in or Log out
** App architecture
*** Most state should be managed by Redux
Read: [[https://github.com/reactjs/redux/issues/1287][choosing between Redux’s store and React’s state]]

*** The store is the single source of truth
**** Components should reference to Redux
**** No direct API call in component’s lifecycle methods
     Updates should be triggered by dispatching action creators.
*** Application should be structured
*** Components should be modular and resusable
** App components logic
*** Data architecture

**** Behaviour of routed component
The list of routed components is the following:
 - =Home=
   - Login is required to view the page
     - Otherwise redirect to SignIn
 - =Leaderboard=
   - Login is required to view the page
     - Otherwise redirect to =SignIn=
 - =NewQuestion=
   - Login is required to view the page
     - Otherwise redirect to SignIn
 - =Question=
   - Login is required to view the page
     - Otherwise redirect to =SignIn=
   - When the matched URL contains an invalid question, redirect to
     =PageNotFound=
 - =User=
   - Login is required to view the page
     - Otherwise redirect to =SignIn=
   - When the matched URL contains an invalid user, redirect to
     =PageNotFound=
 - =SignIn=
 - =PageNotFound=

Since many pages (or component) require the user to be logged-in, we
must use a compone that will provide that behaviour.

*** =Home= Component
The =Home= component will provide two list of questions:
 - Unanswered questions
 - Answered questions

Two tabs will be used while showing unanswered questions by default.
This behaviour will be included in the =QuestionList= component.

**** Overview
#+caption: Mockup of =Home= component
#+RESULTS:
[[file:images/home_overview.png]]

This is the view of the =home= component.

1. is a =Question= component
2. is a =Tab.Menu= component
3. is the =Tab.Segment= component
4. is a =QuestionExcerpt= component

**** Data of =Home=
This component will be a connected component to the Redux store.  The
following state properties will be used for mapping:
 - =questions=
 - =authedUser=

The properties mapped will be the following:
 - =answeredQuestions=
   - Obtained by filtering =questions= the current =authedUser= has
     answered and returning the question’s ID property.
 - =unansweredQuestions=
   - Obtained by filtering =questions= the current =authedUser= has
     not answered and returning the question’s ID property.

#+begin_src plantuml :file images/home_component_data.png

  }
#+end_src
#+caption: Data of Home component
#+RESULTS:
[[file:images/home_component_data.png]]

***** =Questions= mapping operations
The =answeredQuestions= will be calculated by first transforming the
=questions= object to a list.  The given list will be filtered by the
predicate that the =authedUser= is included in one of the two options
of the question.  The remaining list will only return the question
IDs.

Likewise =unansweredQuestions= will be calculated by first
transforming the =questions= object to a list.  The given list will be
filtered by the predicate that the =authedUser= is *not* included in
one of the two options of the question.  The remaining list will only
return the question IDs

#+caption: Mapped state properties to the =Home= component properties
#+begin_src js
  function mapStateToProps({ questions, authedUser }) {
    const answeredQuestions = Object.values(questions)
          .filter((question) => question.optionOne.votes.includes(authedUser)
                  || question.optionTwo.votes.includes(authedUser))
          .map((question) => question.id);
    const unansweredQuestions = Object.values(questions)
      .filter((question) => !question.optionOne.votes.includes(authedUser)
              && !question.optionTwo.votes.includes(authedUser))
      .map((question) => question.id);
    return {
      answeredQuestions,
      unansweredQuestions,
    };
  }
#+end_src

**** Tree of =Home=
The following components components will be children of =Home=
 - =Body= for layout
   - =QuestionList= to show answered and unanswered questions.  Both
     properties passed to the component will be a list of question IDs
     as string

*** =Leaderboard= Component
The =Leaderboard= component will contain a list of users sorted by
their rank.  Each user will be clickable to show their page.

**** Overview
#+caption: Mockup of =Leaderboard= component
#+RESULTS:
[[file:images/leaderboard_overview.png]]

This is the view of the =Leaderboard= component.

 1. will be a =UserCard= component
 2. will be a =ScoreTable= component
 3. will be a =RankLabel= component
 4. will be a =UserScore= component
 5. might be a =UserAvatar= component

**** Data of =Leaderboard=
This component will be a connected component to the Redux store.  The
following state properties will be used for mapping:
 - =questions=
 - =users=

The properties mapped will be the following:
 - users
   - Obtained by sorting the users by their score (generated in the
     mapping function) and a corresponding rank will be added.

#+begin_src plantuml :file images/leaderboard_component_data.png
  skinparam {
      titleBorderRoundCorner 15
      titleBorderThickness 2
      titleBorderColor black

      UsersObject : users
  }
#+end_src
#+caption: Data of =Leaderboard= component
#+RESULTS:
[[file:images/leaderboard_component_data.png]]

***** =Leaderboard= mapping operations
First, the =users= object will be transformed to a list from the
object’s values.  This allows sorting users more easily.

In order to calculate the score for each user, the number of answered
questions and asked questions will be calculated.  The score is both
numbers added.  Both numbers can be calculated by looking into the
=questions= object.

While sorting the users by their newly added score (by spreading the
user with the score), generate a new set containing all the scores
sorted.  By converting the new set to a list, we can lookup the rank
of each user score.

The scores will be added to the users list.

#+caption: Mapped state properties to the =Leaderboard= component properties
#+begin_src js
  function userScore(userID, questions) {
    const createdQuestions = questions.reduce(
      (accumulator, question) => (accumulator + (question.author === userID ? 1 : 0)),
      0,
    );
    const answeredQuestions = questions.reduce(
      (accumulator, question) => {
        const answered = question.optionOne.votes.includes(userID)
              || question.optionTwo.votes.includes(userID);

        return accumulator + answered;
      },
      0,
    );

    return {
      answeredQuestions,
      createdQuestions,
      score: answeredQuestions + createdQuestions,
    };
  }
  function mapStateToProps({ questions, users }) {
    const questionList = Object.values(questions);
    const userWithScore = Object.values(users).map((user) => ({
      ...user,
      ...userScore(user.id, questionList),
    })).sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score);

    // Remove duplicates
    const scores = [...new Set(userWithScore.map((user) => user.score))];
    const userWithRank = userWithScore.map((user) => ({
      ...user,
      rank: scores.indexOf(user.score) + 1,
    }));

    return {
      users: userWithRank,
